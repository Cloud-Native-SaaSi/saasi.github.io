The *Deployer* is a Golang service to deploy packaged installers generated by the [Exporter](../exporter) to a newly provisioned Kubernetes environment.

Optionally, the application can be deployed on an existing, unmanaged cluster.

The *Deployer* application is based on [kustomize](https://kustomize.io/) and provides options to customize:
* The destination namespaces
* The relevant application parameters and secrets
* The application images (*WIP*)

Optionally, the application can be executed as a plain CLI tool. Download the latest binaries from the [latest release](https://github.com/Cloud-Native-SaaSi/saasi-deployer/releases/).
