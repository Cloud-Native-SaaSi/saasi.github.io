# What is SaaSi
SaaSi is the *Service as a Service installer* platform to accelerate and automate packaging and deployments of containerized applications in *Kubernetes* environments.

It's the tool *SRE* can use to generate the installer for their company's software.

And it's also the tool that *Service Deployers* can use to distribute and install fully configured and validated environments to the end client .

## Two in one
SaaSi starts from a validated setup to replicate both the cluster and the application, applying all the customizations you need.

## Why SaaSi
SaaSi takes the deployment of containerized applications to the next level, building a package that includes the entire software infrastructure together
with the target Kubernetes environment.

Replicating a validated environment is made easy with SaaSi, and multiple replicas can be started and managed, each with its own customization.

With Saasi you can extract minimal set of settings from your application, simplifying deployment configuration by various orders of magnitude.
